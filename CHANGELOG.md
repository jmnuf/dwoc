Just c compiler settings changed and some fixes ensued by compiler finds.

# v0.0.1-alpha

First semi-working version with numbers and simple function calls

- Variable/Constant declaration with `:=` and `::` syntax respectively
- Function declaration with `fn` keyword
- Function calls with 0 or 1 argument get called ie `foo(); bar(a);` argument has to be an identifier for now
